#### About the Jiachen Project
<p align="center">
    <img src="./docs/images/jiachenjihua.png" width="300" />
</p>

The Jiachen Project (RISC-V Prosperity 2036) was born on New Year's Eve 2024. It was jointly initiated by several domestic RISC-V software and chip teams and has attracted dozens of domestic and foreign companies engaged in RISC-V product and software development to join. We believe that the RISC-V ecosystem is entering the initial stage of unprecedented explosive growth: in 2025, RISC-V may welcome more than 1 million RISC-V application developers, and at the same time RISC-V will enter the world's top 500 supercomputers in 2025 and the top 10 in 2030. We are in a golden age of computer architecture and basic software systems, and the open instruction set architecture has brought a large number of new scientific problems and engineering challenges.
