#### Introduce

AtomUI is an implementation of Ant Design based on .NET technology, dedicated to bringing the excellent and efficient
design language and experience of Ant Design to the Avalonia/.NET cross-platform desktop software development field.

Welcome to communicate and give suggestions to AtomUI, thank you for giving the project a Star.

#### Features

- Enterprise-class UI designed from Ant Design system for cross platform desktop applications.
- A set of high-quality Avalonia Controls out of the box.
- Use .NET development to achieve one-stop writing, seamless compilation on mainstream operating system platforms and
  render a consistent UI experience.
- Based on Avalonia's powerful style system, Ant Design's theme customization capabilities are fully implemented.

#### Get Started

##### Add nuget package:

AtomUI is recommended to be installed as a nuget package. We have uploaded AtomUI OSS-related packages to nuget.org.
Currently, AtomUI
has not released a long-term support version, so it is recommended to install the latest version we have released

The packages we have released are as follows:

| Package                  | Description                                                                                                                                |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AtomUI                   | Main library, includes the theme system and all controls of the AtomUI OSS version                                                         |
| AtomUI.Controls.DataGrid | Data grid control definitions. Can be omitted if not used.                                                                                 |
| AtomUI.Generator         | Source generator definitions required for custom controls. Required if integrating with AtomUI theme system when creating custom controls. |
| AtomUI.IconPkg.Generator | Required if you need to create custom icon packages.                                                                                       |

```bash
dotnet add package AtomUI --version 0.0.6-build.4
```

#### About the Jiachen Project

<p align="center">
    <img src="./resources/images/readme/jiachenjihua.png" width="300" />
</p>

The Jiachen Project (RISC-V Prosperity 2036) was born on New Year's Eve 2024. It was jointly initiated by several
domestic RISC-V software and chip teams and has attracted dozens of domestic and foreign companies engaged in RISC-V
product and software development to join. We believe that the RISC-V ecosystem is entering the initial stage of
unprecedented explosive growth: in 2025, RISC-V may welcome more than 1 million RISC-V application developers, and at
the same time RISC-V will enter the world's top 500 supercomputers in 2025 and the top 10 in 2030. We are in a golden
age of computer architecture and basic software systems, and the open instruction set architecture has brought a large
number of new scientific problems and engineering challenges.
