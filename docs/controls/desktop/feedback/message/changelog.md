# Message Changelog

本文档记录 Message 控件级设计、API、主题契约、Token 和实现结构的变化。它不替代仓库根目录 `CHANGELOG.md`，也不作为正式版本发布说明。

## 2026-09-11

- Semantic Part
  - Make the implicit `root` surface actually customizable: `MessageCardTheme.axaml` now projects `Background` / `BorderBrush` / `BorderThickness` / `CornerRadius` / `BoxShadow` / `Padding` from the owner onto `Border#PART_Frame` via `TemplateBinding`, and those token values moved to owner-level ControlTheme setters so the default look is unchanged. Previously every surface setter was silently ignored (measured: `Background=Red` left the frame `White`, `CornerRadius=16` left it `8,8,8,8`), so `semantic-part.md` §2.1's claim that the card could be customized this way was false.
  - Add `MessageCard.BoxShadowProperty` (`Border.BoxShadowProperty.AddOwner<MessageCard>()`, same pattern as `Card` / `InputControlFrame`), which the upstream `root` style needs for its hard shadow.
  - Coverage: `Root_Surface_Properties_Project_Onto_The_Frame_And_Keep_Token_Defaults` (control layer) and `Message_Semantic_Style_Buttons_Produce_Styled_Cards` (end-to-end), the latter failing when the theme projection is reverted.
  - Gallery: rewrite the `Custom Semantic Part styling` example to strictly mirror `components/message/demo/style-class.tsx` — an object-style success message (`#F6FFED` / `#95DE64` / radius 16 / `4 4 0 #D9F7BE`, green icon and title) and a function-style error message whose `:error` branch turns the whole card red (`#FFF2F0` / `#FFCCC7` / `#CF1322` / `4 4 0 #FFCCC7`). Both are emitted by the real buttons through `Show(IMessage, string[]? classes)`, the AtomUI equivalent of the upstream per-message `styles` prop, instead of the previous static two-card comparison whose values did not come from the demo.
  - Fix the example `BadgeText` to `{x:Static gallery:GalleryVersionInfo.DisplayVersion}` (`v6.1.8`, from `build/Versions.props`). It was hardcoded `v6.0`, violating `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-12-semantic-part-control-rollout-design.md` §8.4.
  - Emit the styled messages where upstream does — at the viewport top via the window feedback layer, not in a page-local container. `WindowMessageManager` is now constructed with the `TopLevel` host for this example (the same pattern as the Notification page), so cards land in `WindowFeedbackLayer`; measured placement 1280×900 is `x=347`, `y=0` (exact horizontal centering), matching the upstream top-of-viewport collapse. Covered by `Message_Semantic_Style_Buttons_Pop_At_The_Window_Feedback_Layer`, which asserts the cards are absent from the page subtree and that all object/error style values reach the frame.
  - Merge the two Semantic Part previews into one, matching the upstream `message#semantic-dom` layout: a single stage hosts both owners and one panel lists all six parts in owner order, with a per-row owner label disambiguating the duplicated `root`. `SemanticPartPreview` gained `SemanticOwners` (multi-owner declaration), `SemanticPartDescription.OwnerType` (disambiguation, required for multi-owner) and per-owner highlight resolution; the single-owner path is unchanged. Covered by `Multi_Owner_Preview_Merges_Part_Lists_In_Declaration_Order` and `Multi_Owner_Description_Without_OwnerType_Is_Rejected`.
  - Fix the `root` / `listContent` geometry to match the upstream layering. `MessageCardToken.MessageTopMargin` (`(m, m, m, 0)` on `Border#PART_Frame`) made the `root` highlight box asymmetric — extra inset on left/top/right and none at the bottom — and the `list` and `listContent` boxes nearly coincided. Spacing now lives where upstream puts it: the list container carries `Padding` (upstream `.ant-message-list` `padding: marginLG`, consumed by a template `Border`), `listContent` carries `Spacing` (upstream `gap: margin`), and the card has no margin at all, so `root` equals the visible card exactly and `listContent` insets symmetrically inside `list`. Measured: card insets 0/0/0/0, list-content insets 24/24/24/24, `Spacing` 16. Not related to `BoxShadow` — shadows do not participate in layout. Covered by `Root_Frame_Has_No_Own_Margin_And_List_Insets_ListContent_Symmetrically`; contract documented in `semantic-part.md` §5.1.
  - Document the merged-preview contract in `semantic-part.md` §5.2.
  - Document the resulting style-scope constraint in `semantic-part.md` §5.3: the feedback layer sits outside the page visual tree, so page-scoped styles cannot reach it (measured; manager / `Window` / `Application` scopes do). The generated style classes therefore stay declaratively written in the page's `UserControl.Resources` and are attached to the manager's `Styles` by code — attachment only, no part-property rewriting.
- Gallery
  - Add localization units `P2ContentObjectStyle`, `P2ContentFunctionStyle`, `P2MessageObjectStyles`, `P2MessageFunctionStyles` (en-US / zh-CN / zh-TW / pt-BR).
  - Remove the shared `SemanticPartAdorner` white halo ring, observed first on this page. The primary marker no longer paints the upstream dumi `Marker` `box-shadow: 0 0 0 1px #fff`; on the light Gallery stage it read as a stray white line. The primary layout outset drops from `3px` to `2px` (half the `2px` pen width) since no outer ring needs space. Covered by the updated `Adorner_Draws_An_Outline_Without_Covering_The_Target` (asserts a single gold drawing and no near-white brush); contract updated in `docs/gallery/authoring/semantic-part-preview.md` §9.
  - Fix a crash when switching the Message page to the Semantic Parts tab: the semantic content template root was a `ScrollContentPresenter`, which does not realize its `Content` into visual children until it is attached, so `GalleryShowCaseHost` judged the template empty and threw. The root is now a plain `StackPanel` (scrolling is already provided by the host's own `ScrollViewer`), matching the other 52 Semantic Part pages. Covered by `Message_Semantic_Previews_Materialize_When_The_Semantic_Tab_Is_Selected`, which fails with the original exception on the previous revision. The template-root contract is tightened in `docs/gallery/authoring/semantic-part-preview.md` §5.
- API
  - Add a public parameterless `WindowMessageManager()` constructor alongside `WindowMessageManager(TopLevel? host)`; the host overload now delegates to it. A null or omitted host means the manager is not installed into a TopLevel layer and renders inline where the caller places it. This makes the control declaratively usable from XAML, mirrors `WindowNotificationManager`, and backs the Gallery semantic preview. Covered by `Parameterless_Manager_Renders_Inline_Without_Taking_Over_The_Host_Layer`.

## 2026-09-10

- Semantic Part
  - Publish two owner descriptors aligned with the upstream Message semantic keys: `MessageCard` exposes `wrapper` / `icon` / `title` (plus implicit `root`) for the notice card, and `WindowMessageManager` exposes `listContent` (plus implicit `root`, which maps the upstream list). `Since` is `6.0` for both.
  - Add generated semantic style types `MessageCardWrapperStyle`, `MessageCardIconStyle`, `MessageCardTitleStyle` and `WindowMessageManagerListContentStyle`.
  - Add static `Classes.semantic-*` markers in `MessageCardTheme.axaml` and `WindowMessageManagerTheme.axaml`; the built-in themes do not consume `.semantic-*` for default visuals.
  - Add `docs/controls/desktop/feedback/message/semantic-part.md` as the authoritative Part contract, and document the descriptor/marker mapping in `implementation.md`.
  - Add `tests/AtomUI.Desktop.Controls.Tests/Message/MessageSemanticPartTests.cs` covering descriptor fields, static markers, state-preserved marker identity, generated style hits, queue/close removal and host detach cleanup.
  - Gallery: add two `SemanticPartPreview` sections (one per owner) plus a `Custom Semantic Part styling` example using the generated style classes.
  - Record the pre-existing gap that `WindowMessageManager` never updates `Position` pseudo-classes, so the theme's `:topcenter` alignment branch is unreachable. It is not part of this Semantic Part change and is tracked in `semantic-part.md` §7.1.

## 2026-08-24

- Motion
  - Reuse the shared internal `AtomUI.MotionScene.MotionExecutionState` for MessageCard exit motion scheduling, playback and final `IsClosed` submission while preserving the public `IsClosing` / `IsClosed` contract.
  - Coalesce property-change and template-reapply close scheduling into one execution flow.
